# What is this project? 

This is just an example for my own reference, based on API in Action by Neil Madden, Chapter 5. Modern Token-Based Authentication

* SPA login/logout flow using token 
* API authentication using token
* Vue frontend 
* Express backend for the API
* Flash messages 
* Bootstrap 5 


#  TODO 

* Create Vue NavBar with LoginItem
* Create vue main page with the button for increaseCounter
* return WWW-Authenticate on 401
